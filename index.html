<h1>THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION</h1></center>

<p><I><h2>Can you imagine education without a technology?Do you believe that life of 
    being a student is quite easy just because of technology?</I></p></h2>
<p>Technology is a powerful tool that can support and transform education in many ways, from making it easier for teachers to create instructional materials to enabling new ways for people to learn and work together. With the worldwide reach of the Internet and the ubiquity of smart devices that can connect to it, a new age of anytime anywhere education is dawning. It will be up to instructional designers and educational technologies to make the most of the opportunities provided
     by technology to change education so that effective and efficient education is available to everyone everywhere.
