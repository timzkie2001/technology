    <p>The evolution of technology has impacted every aspect of our lives from banking to the way that we communicate with each other. In fact, technology has become an integral part of sustaining society, and its infusion with education is therefore inevitable. Technology not only provides students with access to countless online resources, but also aids them in the learning process. A majority of universities and educational institutes have already started to utilise technology within their teaching methods.

        Why is it important to use technology in teaching?
        
        Students are often bombarded with information in a classroom which they must quickly attempt to process and make sense of. However, this can leave them feeling overwhelmed and confused by concepts. Technology provides students with access to countless online resources, encouraging them to carry out research and therefore become more independent. It also simplifies learning by making concepts more digestible, for example through an instructional video. It is important to recognise that there are various learning styles and traditional education may not be catering to them all.
        
        Some people do not thrive in classroom settings and therefore having access to things like online courses can allow them to gain qualifications that they may not have been otherwise able to acquire. <br>Students can find it difficult to remain engaged in the things that they are being taught, therefore the use of technology is crucial in holding their attention to allow them to absorb information better. Technology can help to provide them with a higher quality of education.
        
        What are the advantages of using technology in education?
        
        Its ease of use and accessibility impacts and benefits both the student and teacher. For example, a teacher can ask students to take an online quiz which will provide them with instant feedback, eliminating the time that the teacher would have otherwise taken to grade and look through each assignment. Technology reduces both the time and cost of teachers and also allows students to remain on top of their education by having permanent access to information, for example being able to check deadlines or emailing a teacher about queries that they may have at any time of the day.
        
        Technology has made it possible for students to gain qualifications online and educate themselves through institutes that offer online courses. They can learn from home without having to pay to commute or move away to attend university. Working professionals have the opportunity to pursue further education without having to give up their full-time jobs. Being able to learn remotely has been revolutionary because it has made education accessible to everyone. Technology is being used to teach differently, whether that through online learning or merely showing a video in a classroom.
        
        Teaching is now more than a lecturer in front of a blackboard and technology has been an integral part of its development. It has transformed education and the way that people learn and retain information. Therefore its role in the future of education is a fundamental part in maintaining the growth and progression of today’s economy.</p>

<p>Importance of Technology in Education!
Technological advancement has also helped the proliferation of education. There is continuous research and development in introducing advanced technologies to make education easier, joyful and accessible.
Education for children is no longer boring and cumbersome as the educational technologies have made it interesting. is the technologies like TV and DVD, internet, telephony, which have made it possible to provide education to the recipient at a distant place. Indira Gandhi National Open University is a premier university offering distance education in India. Most Indian states have also established open universities.

There was a time, not long ago, when women were not allowed to receive education. A few women of the exceptionally distinguished families of higher castes did receive it but not in the educational institution outside home. But, generally, women were denied formal education.

It is with the onset of modern­ization that people’s attitudes particularly that of the higher castes and classes, towards women education have changed. Though there has been tremendous improvement in the level of education among women, it is still far behind that of the men. It is not gender discrimination and male chauvinism which denied
 education to girls in the past but that the girls were not allowed to go outside homes for education for many reasons
They were susceptible to eve teasing and physical threats. Vulnerability was much greater when they moved around alone on the street. But, today, revolution in the field of automobiles has made it convenient for girls to go to educational institutions and coaching centres without much fear and vulnerability, no matter how far the institutions are.
The number of female students has gone up today simply because of fast and safe conveyance apart from a shift in the attitudes of people from gender
 discrimi­nation to gender equality. Thus, the role of technology in the expansion of education among women is enormous.</p>
